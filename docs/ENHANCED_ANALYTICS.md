## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### New Indexes for Performance

```sql

CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_referrer_domain ON submissions(referrer_domain);
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_utm_source ON submissions(utm_source);
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. **Updated Logger Service** (`app/services/logger.py`)

**New methods:**
- `get_geo_data(ip)` - Calls free ip-api.com API for location data
- `parse_user_agent(ua)` - Extracts browser, OS, device type from user agent
- `parse_referrer(url)` - Extracts domain and UTM parameters

**Enhanced `log_submission()`:**
- Now accepts `request_data` dict with all metadata
- Async IP geolocation lookup
- Comprehensive data collection before insert

### 2. **Updated View Handler** (`app/views/pages.py`)

**New form parameters (optional):**
- All client-side metrics as `Form(None)` parameters
- Extracted from HTMX request before submission

**Enhanced calculate endpoint:**
- Collects server-side data (IP, user agent, referrer, language)
- Receives client-side data from JavaScript
- Passes everything to logger as `request_data` dict
- Async task creation for non-blocking logging

### 3. **Client-Side Tracking** (`app/templates/index.html`)

**New JavaScript functionality:**
- `htmx:configRequest` event listener
- Collects browser capabilities and screen info
- Generates/retrieves session ID from sessionStorage
- Adds metadata to HTMX request parameters
- Tracks page load time for completion duration

**Collected client-side:**
- Screen dimensions & color depth
- Viewport size & pixel ratio
- Time to complete (page load ‚Üí submit)
- Browser capabilities (cookies, WebGL, touch, etc.)
- Session ID (unique per browser session)

## üìà Analytics Queries You Can Run

### Most Active Regions
```sql
SELECT region, city, COUNT(*) as submissions
FROM submissions
WHERE country_code = 'ZA'
GROUP BY region, city
ORDER BY submissions DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Device Type Distribution
```sql
SELECT device_type, COUNT(*) as count,
       ROUND(AVG(effective_rate), 2) as avg_rate
FROM submissions
GROUP BY device_type;
```

### Traffic Sources
```sql
SELECT referrer_domain, COUNT(*) as visits
FROM submissions
WHERE referrer_domain IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY referrer_domain
ORDER BY visits DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Browser Breakdown
```sql
SELECT browser, os, COUNT(*) as submissions
FROM submissions
GROUP BY browser, os
ORDER BY submissions DESC;
```

### Time to Complete Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(time_to_complete_seconds) as avg_seconds,
    MIN(time_to_complete_seconds) as fastest,
    MAX(time_to_complete_seconds) as slowest
FROM submissions
WHERE time_to_complete_seconds IS NOT NULL;
```

### Screen Resolution Popular Types
```sql
SELECT screen_width, screen_height, COUNT(*) as count
FROM submissions
WHERE screen_width IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY screen_width, screen_height
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### UTM Campaign Performance
```sql
SELECT utm_campaign, utm_source, utm_medium,
       COUNT(*) as submissions,
       ROUND(AVG(total_to_govt), 2) as avg_total
FROM submissions
WHERE utm_campaign IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY utm_campaign, utm_source, utm_medium
ORDER BY submissions DESC;
```

### Geographic Heatmap Data
```sql
SELECT city, latitude, longitude, COUNT(*) as submissions,
       ROUND(AVG(effective_rate), 2) as avg_rate
FROM submissions
WHERE latitude IS NOT NULL AND country_code = 'ZA'
GROUP BY city, latitude, longitude
ORDER BY submissions DESC;
```

## üîí Privacy & Compliance

### ‚úÖ POPIA Compliant
- **No personal identifiable information (PII)** stored
- IP addresses are **hashed (SHA-256)** - not reversible
- No names, emails, phone numbers, or ID numbers
- Geographic data at city level (not exact GPS)
- Session IDs are random, not linked to users
- Browser capabilities are anonymous

### Optional Metadata
All new fields are **nullable** - if data can't be collected, submission still succeeds:
- Geo lookup failures don't block inserts
- Client-side JS disabled? No problem
- Logger errors never fail the main request

### User Control
- Do Not Track header respected and logged
- Cookies not required for functionality
- LocalStorage optional (for form persistence only)
- No cross-site tracking

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Supabase Database
Run the updated `scripts/supabase_setup.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:
- Drops and recreates `submissions` table with all new columns
- Adds new indexes for query performance
- Disables RLS for public inserts

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
# Start server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Submit form at http://127.0.0.1:8000
# Check Supabase Table Editor for new submission with full metadata
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway
- Push code to GitHub
- Railway auto-deploys
- Environment variables already configured (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)

### 4. Verify in Production
- Submit form on Railway URL
- Check Supabase submissions table
- Verify geographic data populated (city, country, etc.)
- Check browser/device data
- Look for referrer and session tracking
