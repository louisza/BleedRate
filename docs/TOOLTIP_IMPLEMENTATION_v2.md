        <span class="tooltip-icon" tabindex="0">?</span>
        <span class="tooltip-text">
            <strong>What is this?</strong><br>
            Clear explanation in plain language<br>
            <div class="tooltip-example">
                ‚úÖ Includes: List of what counts<br>
                ‚ùå Excludes: List of what doesn't count
            </div>
        </span>
    </span>
</label>
```

### Fields That Need Tooltips (Priority Order):

#### üî¥ **High Priority (Most Confusing)**
1. ‚úÖ **VAT-able Spending** - Users don't know what includes VAT
2. ‚úÖ **Accommodation** - Is it my house or hotels?
3. **Embedded Corporate Tax** - What is this?
4. **Property Transfer Duty** - When does this apply?
5. **Import Duty** - Do I pay this?
6. **Sugary Drinks** - How do I calculate this?

#### üü° **Medium Priority**
7. **Annual Bonus** - Is 13th cheque included?
8. **Medical Aid Members** - Who counts?
9. **Retirement Contributions** - What qualifies?
10. **Petrol/Diesel** - How to estimate liters?
11. **Electricity (kWh)** - How to find this?
12. **Beer/Wine/Spirits** - Standard drink sizes?

#### üü¢ **Nice to Have**

### Tooltip Content Guidelines:

1. **Start with a Question**: "What is this?" or "What counts?"
2. **Simple Explanation**: One sentence in plain English
3. **Includes/Excludes**: Use ‚úÖ and ‚ùå emojis
4. **Examples**: Real-world scenarios
5. **Typical Values**: Help users estimate if unsure

### Example Tooltips:

#### VAT-able Spending
```
What is this?
Most things you buy include 15% VAT that goes to government.

‚úÖ Includes: Groceries, clothes, electronics, restaurant meals
‚ùå Excludes: Rent, school fees, medical aid, some basic foods

Typical: R10,000 - R20,000/month
```

#### Accommodation
```
What counts as accommodation?
Only commercial accommodation like hotels, Airbnb, B&Bs.

‚úÖ Includes: Hotels, guest houses, Airbnb, lodges
‚ùå Excludes: Your own home/rent, staying with friends

Typical: R5,000 - R15,000/year for holidays
```

#### Embedded Corporate Tax
```
What is this?
Companies pay 27% tax, which they pass to you in higher prices.
We estimate ~12% of your spending goes to this hidden tax.

This is automatically calculated - you don't enter anything.
```

#### Property Transfer Duty
```
When do I pay this?
Only when buying a property. It's a one-time tax.

‚úÖ Pay if: Buying a house/flat this year
‚ùå Don't pay if: Renting, already own, or property under R1.1M

Enter the purchase price only if buying this year.
```

#### Annual Bonus
```
What counts as a bonus?
Any extra payments beyond your monthly salary.

‚úÖ Includes: 13th cheque, performance bonus, commission
‚ùå Excludes: Regular overtime, allowances (already in salary)

Leave blank if you only get 12 months' salary.
```

#### Medical Aid Members
```
Who counts as a member?
You plus any dependents on your medical aid.

Examples:
- Just you = 1
- You + spouse = 2
- You + spouse + 2 kids = 4

This gives you a tax credit to reduce your PAYE.
```
